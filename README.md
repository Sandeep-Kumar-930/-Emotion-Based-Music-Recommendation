# 🎵 Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

An AI-powered system that detects user emotions from **facial expressions** (using CNN) and **text sentiment** (using NLP), then recommends matching music from YouTube.

## 📌 Features
- 🎭 Facial emotion detection via webcam (CNN model)
- ✍ Text-based sentiment analysis (NLP model)
- 🎶 YouTube-based music recommendations
- 📊 Trained on **Sentiment140** dataset for text sentiment
- 📷 Real-time emotion prediction using OpenCV

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**, **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **NLTK**, **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualizations)
- **IDE**: VS Code / PyCharm

Do you want me to also **add the YouTube links in the README** so people can see example recommended songs? That would make the GitHub page more interactive.
